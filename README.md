# OOP-Dinosaurs-game

## Project description

This project was implemented over the course of 6 weeks with two other teammates. 
With the game engine provided, our team worked to build on it to develop a dinosaurs game with OOP and design principles (SOLID, DRY) in mind. 
A [design rationale (and other design documents)](https://github.com/J-asy/OOP-Dinosaurs-game/tree/master/docs) was prepared for each iteration of the design.
At the end of the project, a document for [recommendations to the game engine](https://github.com/J-asy/OOP-Dinosaurs-game/blob/master/docs/Assignment%203%20docs/Recommendations%20for%20engine%20Assignment%203.pdf) was written with the pros and cons of the suggestions made based on design principles to improve its design.

A [jar file](https://github.com/J-asy/OOP-Dinosaurs-game/blob/master/dino%20game.jar) is available for download to run the game on your command prompt easily:
1. `cd directory-containing-jar-file`
2. `java -jar "dino game.jar"`


## Game description

This is a text-based “rogue-like” game. Rogue-like games are named after the first such program: a fantasy game named rogue. 
They were very popular in the days before home computers were capable of elaborate graphics.

In this game, you are running a dinosaur park. Dinosaurs can eat, breed, attack other dinosaurs and even fly. 
Players must care for the dinosaurs and maintain an ecological balance so that they have enough to eat.
