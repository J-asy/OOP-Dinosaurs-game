# OOP-Dinosaurs-game

## Project description

This project was implemented over the course of 6 weeks with two other teammates. 
With the game engine provided, our team worked to build on it to develop a dinosaurs game with OOP and design principles (SOLID, DRY) in mind. 
A [design rationale (and other design documents)](https://github.com/J-asy/OOP-Dinosaurs-game/tree/master/docs) was prepared for each iteration of the design.
At the end of the project, a document for [recommendations to the game engine](https://github.com/J-asy/OOP-Dinosaurs-game/blob/master/docs/Assignment%203%20docs/Recommendations%20for%20engine%20Assignment%203.pdf) was written with the pros and cons of the suggestions made based on design principles to improve its design.

A [jar file](https://github.com/J-asy/OOP-Dinosaurs-game/blob/master/dino%20game.jar) is available for download to run the game on your command prompt easily:
1. `cd directory-containing-jar-file`
2. `java -jar "dino game.jar"`


## Game description

This is a text-based “rogue-like” game. Rogue-like games are named after the first such program: a fantasy game named rogue. 
They were very popular in the days before home computers were capable of elaborate graphics.

In this game, you are running a dinosaur park. Dinosaurs can eat, breed, attack other dinosaurs and even fly. 
Players must care for the dinosaurs and maintain an ecological balance so that they have enough to eat.

The following table contains the symbols representing different characters / items in the game for easy reference.
| Character | Symbol |
| -------- | ------ |
| player | @ |
| Stegosuar | s |
| Brachiosaur | b |
| Allosaur | a |
| Pterodactyl | p |
| Fruits on the ground | F |
| Small bush | ~ |
| Big bush | * |
| Bush with fruits | ^ |
| Small tree | ~ |
| Medium sized tree | t |
| Big tree | T |
| Tree with fruits | & |
| Lake | ~ |
| Egg | o |
| Coprse | % |
| MealKitsItem | = |
| Bridge | ! |

Note that the baby dinosaurs have lowercase symbols, while adult dinosaurs have uppercase symbols. Eg, baby stegosaurus - s; matured stegosaurus - S.
